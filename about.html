									<h1>Mason <br>Flannery</h1>
								</header>
								<!-- Summary -->
								<p>
									Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Mason, a recent BYU graduate in statistics with an emphasis in data science. 
									I loved my time there and enjoyed getting to learn so much about math, statistics, and machine learning.
									It has equipped me with the skills to extract valuable insights from raw data, and I'm excited to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.
									As a dedicated learner, I strive to stay updated on the latest advancements in machine learning and computer science, and I'm currently working towards obtaining IBM's Data Science certification.
									I'm eager to showcase my data science expertise through the rest of the portfolio!

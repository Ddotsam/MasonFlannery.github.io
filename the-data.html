								<h1>Everything about The Data</h1>
							</header>
							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>
								Unforunantly, there is no widly available database for this kind of project. 
								There are, however, various websites and API's that contained statistics sufficient for the project. 
								Using multiple sources, I created an accurate database with nearly all the statistics available on teams and players in general.
								I also created a custom power ranking system using the Elo algorithm since everything I could find on the subject was innacurate for reasons that will be discussed later.
								After collecting the data, I explored it using statistical graphs.
								Then, I decided which features I wanted to use to build the models.
								Finally, I normalized all the relevant features so that they would be more useful in logistic regression output.
							</p>
							<h2>
								Data Collection
							</h2>
							<p>
								Nearly all of the data comes from one of two soures: Dotabuff or OpenDota API. 
								If I discovered that some of the data was wrong, I would get the correct data from various sources that are unlisted.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Dotabuff
							</h3>
							<p>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/dotabuff.jpg" alt="Logo for the Dota Pro Circuit" /></span>
								Much of the individual player data came from a Dota 2 statistical website called Dotabuff.
								It contains statistical data regarding teams, players, and individual matches.
								There is no Dotabuff API, so I utilized webscraping to gather information from this resource.
								Luckily, nearly all of the information available on Dotabuff proved to be accurate.
								Thus, whenever, the other sources of information were discovered wrong, I would generally turn to Dotabuff for the correct answer.
							</p>

							<h3>
								OpenDota API
							</h3>
							<p>
								OpenDota is a REST API that provides free data related to many aspects of Dota 2.
								I primarly used it for finding match data as much of the data available was innacurate.
							</p>
							<!--Problems:
							Very few relialbe sources.
							I wanted data that was recent because the teams change so often -->
							<h2>
								Dataset Description
							</h2>
							<p>
								The dataset comprises a collection of professional Dota 2 matches, with each match represented as a separate observation. 
								As Dota is a team game, most of the data actually used for building the models deals exclusively with performance of the team.
								However, there was no reliable source for the team statistics, so I built all of the team statistics using my own methods.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Player Statistics
							</h3>
							<p>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/DPC.jpg" alt="Logo for the Dota Pro Circuit" /></span>
								Individual player statistcs were gathered from Dotabuff. 
								This includes features such as gold earned per minute (GPM) and experience earned per minute (XPM) for all 5 players on the team, and the GPM, XPM, and last hit number for the position 1 and position 5 players on every team.
							</p>

							<h3>Team and Match Statistics</h3>
							<p>
								I included only matches from the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC), a professional esports tournament system for qualifying for the world championship: The International (TI).
								Reasoning behind this decision and many others will be included in the <a href="challenges">Challenges and Limitations</a> section.
								Using the individual player statistics, I was able to group all the data into team statistics.
								These team statistics were calculated as the summation of the respective statistic across each of the 5 players.
								Match statistics include categorical variables such as division type and the game version that the match was played on.
							</p>


							<h3>
								Exploratory Data Analysis
							</h3>
							<p>
								Before I began feeding the factors into the algorithms, I wanted to examine the variables to take note of any trends.
								One important observation of which to take note is that player statistics were generally skewed and bi-modal. 
								On the other hand, team statistics were approximately normal, as you can see in the histograms below. <br>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/gpm-hists.jpeg" alt="" /></span><br>
								Upon further consideration, this is exactly what one would expect! 
								The two roles in the game correspond directly to the bi-modal nature of the individual player statistcs.
								Also, as the team statistics are the summation of a random variable, they are susceptable to the central limit theorem. 
							</p>

								Challenges and Limitations
							</h2>

							<h3>
								Team/Game Volatility
							</h3>
							<p>
								As mentioned before, I only included matches that occured in the DPC.
								Even though this limited my dataset from tens of thousands of matches to thousands, I felt this was necessary because every DPC tournament has a prize pool of at least $75,000, and I wanted to only include matches where the players would try as hard as they could.
								This also affected the Elo algorithm that I implemented as it helped control for variation corrected for in other power ranking systems such as Glicko or Glicko-2, the latter being what Valve currently uses to rank players.
								Additionally, unlike sports like baseball or basketball, Dota 2 goes through regular updates and rule changes, and the teams go through impactful roster changes. 
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/team-secret.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								All sources I could find simply aggregated lifetime statistics for each team and player, which would be useless in any type of prediction.
								For example, lets follow the performance of Team Secrete, a professional team.
								Last year, Team Secret placed second in TI, winning several hundred thousands of dollars.
								However, this year, due to some roster changes, the team is struggling to compete in division 2 matches, the lowest skill division in DPC tournaments.
								Many teams undergo similar changes every year, if not more often.
								I suspect that this is the reason there has not been a proper treatment on this problem despite the prolific betting scene for professional matches: as soon as I realized I would have to gather all of the data from scratch, I understood that this was a much more difficult undertaking than I originally assumed.
								I corrected for this by creating all of the team statistics based on aggregated values of the players currently playing for the team.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Data Inaccuracies/Irrelevancies
							</h3>
							<p>
								Much of the data widly avalable through API's, including OpenDota, was completely inaccurate.
								After cross checking the data from OpenDota, I discovered that all of the information on team rosters, team Elo scores, and player statistics was wrong.
								I corrected for this by including information from Dotabuff, as discussed earlier.
								Also, I corrected for the Elo inaccuracies by customizing my own Elo rankings through modification of the k-parameter and the win/loss outcome mappings.

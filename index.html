									<h2>Predicting Dota 2</br>Professional Games</h2>
									<p>
										My most recent project focusing on predicting the outcome of a given professional match of Dota 2, a MOBA video game. 
										This project combines my passion for data science and my interest in gaming.

								<h2>
									Project Summary
								</h2>
								<p>
									The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the outcome of professional Dota 2 matches based on various factors such as team performance, player statistics, and tournament characteristics. 
									By leveraging machine learning techniques and statistical modeling, I aim to provide valuable insights into the factors that influence professional match outcomes in Dota 2.
								</p>

								<h2>
									Problem Statement
								</h2>
								<p>
									The unpredictable nature of Dota 2 matches in general poses a challenge for both players and fans who are interested in understanding the factors that contribute to winning or losing a game. 
									By developing a predictive model, we can gain insights into the key determinants of match outcomes and enhance our understanding of the game dynamics.
								</p>

								<h2>
									Techniques Used
								</h2>
								<p>
									In this project, I employed a combination of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling. 
									The data preprocessing phase involved collecting everything from scratch.
									I then developed my own power ranking using a modified Elo algorithm to help rank the teams.
									I cleaned and transformed the raw dataset into a more useful body. 
									Then, exploratory data analysis and knowledge of the game helped uncover patterns and relationships within the data. 
									Feature engineering allowed me to create meaningful predictors for the model. 
									Additionally, I utilized machine learning algorithms, namely XGBoost and logistic regression, to build predictive models for match outcomes.
									Finally, The models were then tested against the performance of 18 teams from all around the world at a highly competitive tournament with a $500,000 prize pool: the Bali Major.
								</p>

								<h2>
									Key Outcomes and Insights
								</h2>
								<p>
									Through this project, I successfully developed a predictive model that achieved a high accuracy in predicting Dota 2 match outcomes. 
									The model incorporated various features, including team performance metrics, player statistics, and tournament characteristics. 
									By analyzing the model's coefficients, I gained insights into the relative importance of different factors in determining match outcomes. 
									Additionally, I identified key patterns and trends in the data that shed light on the strategies and dynamics of successful Dota 2 gameplay.
									<br><br>
									Overall, this project not only demonstrates my proficiency in data science techniques but also highlights my ability to apply these skills in the context of an engaging and complex domain like Dota 2. 
									It is a testament to my passion for both data analysis and gaming, and I am excited to share this project and its insights with you. 
									Feel free to explore below to see the highlights of the project!

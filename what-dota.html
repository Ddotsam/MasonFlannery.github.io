                                <h2>TL;DR</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed by Valve.
                                    The game features matches between two teams of five players, each defending their own base on the map.
                                    Players control powerful characters called "heroes" with unique abilities and play styles.
                                    The goal is to collect experience, purchase items, and defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat.
                                    The team that destroys the other team's "Ancient" structure within their base wins the game.
                                    Below, a more nuanced explanation is offered, with <a href="#the-resources">the resources</a> and <a href="#the-items">the items</a> sections most germane to the development of the model.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                                <h3>The Heroes</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="image left"><img src="images/dota-heroes.jpg" alt="A selection of various Dota 2 heroes" /></span>
                                    At the beginning of the game, 10 players are divided into two teams: Radiant and Dire.
                                    Each player selects a hero from a pool of 124 heroes.
                                    Heroes have distinct designs, strengths, and weaknesses.
                                    They are categorized as core (sometimes referred to as "carry") or support roles, with core heroes growing stronger as the game progresses and support heroes providing assistance to the core heroes
                                    Heroes are assigned positions 1 to 5 based on their resource dependency.
                                    Positions 1, 2, and 3 are generally considered cores as they are the most dependent on the game's resources, while positions 4 and 5 are considered support positions. 
                                    Heroes respawn after death, with the respawn time increasing as the game progresses.
                                </p>
                                <h3>The Map</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="image right"><img src="images/dota-map.jpg" alt="A map of the playing field" /></span>
                                    The map is divided by a river, with Radiant spawning in the bottom left corner and Dire spawning in the top right corner.
                                    Each base is protected by towers and barracks. 
                                    Lanes, designated as top, middle, and bottom, connect the river to the bases.
                                    The towers dwell in the lanes, designated as top, middle, and bottom. 
                                    To destroy the enemy team's ancient and win the game, a team must destroy all towers in a lane, as well as the tier 4 towers. 
                                    Upon destruction, each of the map's buildings (commonly called "objectives") reward the entire enemy team with a set gold bounty.
                                </p>
                                <h3 id="the-resources">The Resources</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="image left"><img src="images/dota-creeps.jpg" alt="A troll camp" /></span>
                                    Gold and experience are the primary resources in the game.
                                    Players earn gold and experience by killing heroes, creeps (computer-controlled entities), and claiming objectives.
                                    Only the player who lands the final blow on a creep earns gold.
                                    Creeps and heroes yield varying amounts of gold and experience, with heroes providing greater rewards.
                                    These resources allow teams to gain an advantage over their enemies and upgrade their heroes' abilities.
                                </p>
                                <h3 id="the-items">The Items</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="image right"><img src="images/dota-items.jpg" alt="A selection of Dota 2 items" /></span>
                                    Items can be purchased by players to enhance their hero's power.
                                    They provide special abilities and can be used to gain an advantage over opponents.
                                    Items are not limited to specific heroes and can be bought multiple times by any number of heroes.
                                    In order to obtain an item, players must be able to afford it with gold that they have obtained from hero, creep, and objective bounties.
                                    As we will learn, proper item selection, combined with player skill, plays a crucial role in a team's success.
                                </p>
